# Introduction

* Discusses algorithms used for evolutionary computation (EC).
* Previous approaches primarily used objective functions.
    * Example: Chinese finger trap
    * Problem: Only finds local optima (deception)
* New Idea: search for novelty instead.
    * Completely ignores the objective
* How can we use these approaches to model evolution?
* Main idea: The objective function isn't as perfect as we used to think, sometimes novelty functions work better.

# Background

* Deception -- when lower-order building blocks are combined and don't lead to a global optimum.
    * Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms can sometimes fight deception by training against multiple objectives.
    * Incremental evolution of objective functions can also help
        * Implies the need to track the "stepping stones" that lead to the objective
* Selection pressure restricts the scope and direction of search
* NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)
    * Evolves artificial neural networks
    * Complexifies the network over generations
